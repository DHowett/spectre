<h1>Ghostbin</h1>
<p>
Ghostbin is a paste service, and I&rsquo;m going to skip explaining
precisely what that is&mdash;it&rsquo;s fairly obvious. The real
interesting questions are &ldquo;why did you build it?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;where did I get all these bees?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
For the first, I&rsquo;d like to first list my inspirations and
driving motives. When I started, I&rsquo;d recently fallen in love
with a small font named <strong>Envy Code R</strong>. I&rsquo;d wanted
to put together a paste service (under my own control) for some time,
and Envy provided the final impetus; It made my code look
awesome&mdash;more awesome, in fact, than my code truly was.
</p>
<p>
At nearly the same time, I&rsquo;d decided that I wanted to learn Go.
The confluence of these two endeavours could not have been more
piquant.
</p>
<p>
Other popular, functional and attractive pastebin services certainly
do exist, but I found them to be somewhat lacking:
<ul>
	<li>Pastie was cool, but the ability to delete private pastes
	eventually evaporated. Later, the ability to even <em>edit</em>
	private pastes&mdash;which was rather useful for affecting a
	simulacrum of deletion&mdash;vanished. Pastie is not
	private by default.</li>

	<li>Pastee is private by default and provides both encryption and
	expiration, but it looks like it tumbled from the proverbial <em>ugly
	tree</em>. It&rsquo;s functional, though, and that&rsquo;s great. It
	seems to use <em>pygments</em>, much like
	Ghostbin, but it doesn&rsquo;t appear to have an updated language list.</li>

	<li>Hastebin looks neat. I have no qualms with it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Ghostbin is an attempt at not only solving the above, but also solving
some issues in the industry such as, but not limited to, me not
knowing Go. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://git.howett.net/paste.git">open-source</a>
and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be going anywhere any time soon.
It supports encryption, expiration, pastes up to one megabyte, and
about six billion languages. Well, some hundreds at the very least.
Also, doesn&rsquo;t that paint job look simply dandy?
</p>
<p>
And&mdash;get your bees away from me. I don&rsquo;t even know what you
were expecting in bringing them here.
